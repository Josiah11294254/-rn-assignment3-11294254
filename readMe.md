# React Native App

This is a simple React Native application that demonstrates the use of `FlatList` and `SectionList` components to display lists of tasks and categories.

## Components

### 1. App
**Description**: The main component that acts as the entry point of the application. It contains the layout and integrates other components.

**Usage**: Used to organize and structure the entire application. It includes the header, lists, and any other main features of the app.

### 2. Background
**Description**: A custom component to provide a consistent background for the app.

**Usage**: Wraps the main content of the app to ensure a uniform background across different screens or components if there are.

### 3. CategoryCards
**Description**: A component designed to display individual category cards.

**Props**:
- `category`: The name of the category.
- `image`: The image associated with the category.
- `description`: A brief description of the category.

**Usage**: Ideal for displaying a visual representation of a category, mostly used within a list to show multiple categories.

### 4. TaskSections
**Description**: A component used to display section headers for a list of tasks.

**Props**:
- `task`: The title of the task section.

**Usage**: Useful for organizing tasks into sections with headers, enhancing readability and organization within lists.

## Data Components

### 1. FlatList
**Description**: A core React Native component for efficiently rendering large lists of data.

**Usage**: Used to display scrollable lists of data where each item is rendered using a custom component.

### 2. SectionList
**Description**: A core React Native component for rendering lists with section headers.

**Usage**: Ideal for displaying lists that need to be categorized into sections. Each section can have a header and individual items.

## Styling

### Stylesheets
**Description**: Styles in React Native are defined using JavaScript objects that mimic CSS styling.

**Usage**: Used to style components, including layout, typography, colors, and spacing. The `StyleSheet.create` method helps in defining and organizing these styles.
